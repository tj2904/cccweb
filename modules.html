                <h3>Architecture and Operating Systems</h3>
                <p class="description">This module provides an introduction to the underlying logical structure of
                    computer systems. It emphasises the logical and theoretical concepts upon which computing systems
                    are physically constructed. Within this module the underpinning decision logic of computer systems
                    is developed alongside an understanding of operating systems.
                    The module aims include: To engage students with the logical concepts that form the basis of
                    computer architectures and organisation, to engage students with the development and functions,
                    architecture and processes of the CPU, to engage students with the development and functions,
                    architecture and processes of operating system software, and to examine the use of algorithms in
                    operating system software.</p>

                <h3>Core Computing Concepts</h3>
                <p class="description">This module covers four foundational topics central to a broad understanding of
                    the discipline of computing science and for developing computing systems. Each topic will be covered
                    over a six week block, knowledge gained will be applied during several later modules and, depending
                    on a student's degree programme, will be developed further. An exploration of the history, major
                    advances and trends in computing are discussed to give students a context for subsequent study.
                    Foundations of computer system usability and cyber security are covered during the next two blocks.
                    The final block introduces a technology that is specific to the student's degree course, but which
                    is not covered in a dedicated module elsewhere at level 4. </p>

                <h3>Database Systems Development</h3>
                <p class="description">This module introduces the use of information systems with specific reference to
                    the use of databases. Using a case study, students follow a systems development lifecycle to learn
                    how to analyse a business-need, collect requirements, create a design for a database and implement
                    their design using industry standard software, using both relational and non-relational database
                    technology.</p>

                <h3>Networks</h3>
                <p class="description">This module introduces computer networks, focusing on data communications.
                    Current and legacy technologies are explored together with the protocols used for developing and
                    managing computer networks. Students will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience during
                    practical lab sessions, these will encompass both Windows and Linux based operating systems.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p class="description">This module covers the theory and practice of developing computer programs,
                    covering both algorithm development and object-oriented programming. The module provides the student
                    with guidance and support to enable them to increase their knowledge and skills in programming
                    irrespective of their starting point. Techniques of program design focusing on algorithm development
                    are taught alongside the Python programming language and object-oriented design alongside
                    appropriate technologies.</p>
